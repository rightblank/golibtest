# golibtest
try to create an go-getable lib
===
this is just for fun
======
add test file 
===

now it's finished you can get it by run 
```
go get -u github.com/rightblank/golibtest
```
but notice that this is really just a test, that only one method
will be able to help you too much, but I had fun :)
